    Welcome to Geospatial à la fran​çaise, a geospatial web app that provides visualisations on arguably the pillars of french culture - cheese and wine. 

    I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new tools. Streamlit has quickly become a popular framework for building data-driven web applications, and I was excited to dive in and explore its capabilities. I've always enjoyed playing around with maps and geodata. This was a greate opportuinty to expand my geospatial data toolkit.
