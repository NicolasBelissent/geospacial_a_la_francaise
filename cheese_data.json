Most of the cheeses cannot be peeled because of the way they are processed. The curds are pressed into blocks resulting, the cheese either crumbles or breaks apart. In case of string cheese, the curds are worked into elastic strips, which are then plaited or twisted. This creates fibres of cheese that can be pulled away in strings. Cow, sheep, and goat milk can be used in the preparation of string cheese. It is popular with children as it is an excellent source of protein and calcium.",

The name Brick is derived from the original cheese making process when artisans used Brick to press the moisture out of the cheese.",

Fresh curds are white, soft and neutral to taste but they are left to ferment to acquire a bit of tanginess. Soft Durkha or Chhurpi is an excellent source of protein and used as a substitute for vegetables in the mountainous region. A curry and/or pickle are made of Chhurpi and is eaten with rice as a staple food in everyday meals.

The taste varies from mild & bland like a classic white American cheese to sharp like a Jack cheese. Smooth, moist and soft in texture, the cheese can develop a strong, pungent aroma if properly aged. Though, its mild flavour goes well with dishes where you do not want the cheese to overpower other ingredients. Compared to the European version, the taste and aroma of American Muenster is milder. Also, it is sold younger than its counterpart.",

Once the cheese has been salted, it is matured for up to six months. But they are turned regularly during this period to develop a complex, delicious, hard cheese.\rWellesley is light cream to white in colour with a slightly crumbly yet firm texture. ",

            "Text": "Wensleydale is an historic fresh, mild cheese that has been made in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire since 1150 by Cistercian monks. These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep's milk was used, but over the time cow's milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer's wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow's milk with sheep's milk added to enhance the flavour. ",
